The WaterTank program simulates a water storage system where users can choose between a Home Tank or Building Tank. It allows filling and using water while showing the current water level and tank status.I also  discovered an efficient solution to avoid repeating code since the two subclasses are very similar, with the only difference being their tank capacities. The name of this file is "Buildingtank_Hometank".
